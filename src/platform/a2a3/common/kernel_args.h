/**
 * KernelArgs Structure - Shared between Host, AICPU, and AICore
 *
 * This structure is used to pass arguments to both AICPU and AICore kernels.
 * It contains pointers to device memory for arguments and graph data.
 *
 * Memory Layout:
 * This structure's layout is hardcoded in libaicpu_extend_kernels.so, which
 * expects specific offsets for deviceArgs fields. The unused[5] array provides
 * the required offset alignment for compatibility with the CANN runtime.

/**
 * Kernel arguments structure
 *
 * This structure is passed to AICPU kernels by the host.
 *
 * Field Access Patterns:
 * - unused[5]: Padding for alignment with CANN runtime expectations
 * - deviceArgs: Written by host, read by AICPU (contains aicpuSoBin/aicpuSoLen)
 * - runtimeArgs: Written by host, read by AICPU (task runtime with execution parameters)
 *                Runtime contains: workers[], worker_count, block_dim, scheCpuNum, tasks[]
 *
 * Note: AICore kernels receive Runtime* directly, not KernelArgs
 *       - AICPU: accesses runtimeArgs->workers, runtimeArgs->block_dim, etc.
 *       - AICore: receives Runtime* pointer with workers at offset 0
